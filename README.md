# TensorBoard-Embedding-Flowers

## Prepare de images

Execute preprocess_db.py - reads all the images from the original DB, change the color to grayscale and resize the
images to (28,28)

**Note: you'll need to change this lines to the paths in your pc where you have de DB and to the path where you want 
to save the copy processed

```python
FL_DB = '/media/andrea/My Passport/flowers/color/'  # change this path to the one in you pc where
# you have the original DB
FL_SV = '/media/andrea/My Passport/flowers/gray/'   # change this path to the one where you want to save
# the processed images 
```
## Execution

Execute feature_extractor.py - it creates all the feature vectors that the projector will use for painting the clusters.

```bash
pá»³thon feature_extractor.py --m X
```

"X" is a number between 1 to 4 which are identificators for the different models from imagenet: 

            1:mobilenet_v2_140_224
            2:inception_v3 
            3:resnet_v2_50 
            4:inception_resnet_v2
```python
if m == "1":  # feature extractor from model mobilenet_v2_140_224
    URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_140_224/feature_vector/2"
elif m == "2":  # feature extractor from model inception_v3
    URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/3"
elif m == "3":  # feature extractor from model resnet_v2_50
    URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_50/feature_vector/1"
elif m == "4":  # feature extractor from model inception_resnet_v2
    URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_resnet_v2/classification/3"
```


Open a terminal in the projector folder where there is another folder named logdir. Type the next command:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir = logdir
```

Logdir has the metadata file needed for coloring the images by labels, the projector configuration file and the 
spritesheet.


**Note: you'll need to change this lines to the paths in your pc where you have de DB, where you have de DB processed
and where you are saving the sprite images.
```python
IM_PATH_RGB = '/media/andrea/My Passport/flowers/color/'  # change this path to the one in you pc where you have
# the original DB
IM_PATH_GRAY = '/media/andrea/My Passport/flowers/gray/'  # change this path to the one in you pc where you have
# the DB images resized and in grayscale
# IM_PATH_SMALL = '/media/andrea/My Passport/flowers/small/'
SPR_PATH = '/home/andrea/PycharmProjects/cluster_visualization/projector/logdir/spritesheet.png'  # change this to
```

## After deploying the projector

Once the projector is deployed you need to adjust the options marked in red circles in the image below.
