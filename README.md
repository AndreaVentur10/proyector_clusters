# TensorBoard-Embedding-Flowers

## Execution

Execute feature_extractor.py - it creates all the feature vectors that the projector will use for painting the clusters.

```bash
pá»³thon feature_extractor.py --m X
```

"X" is a number between 1 to 4 which are identificators for the different models from imagenet: 

1:mobilenet_v2_140_224/ 2:inception_v3/ 3:resnet_v2_50/ 4:inception_resnet_v2

Open a terminal in the projector folder where there is another folder named logdir. Type the next command:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir = logdir
```

Logdir has the metadata file needed for coloring the images by labels, the projector configuration file and the 
spritesheet.

## After deploying the projector

Once the projector is deployed you need to adjust the options marked in red circles in the image below.
